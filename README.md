## How to ask a structured question

1. First **identify the problem** correctly
2. And then check if you **can't already find a solution?**
3. Try to be as **structured** as possible when describing your problem:
   1. Have a good **title** that summarises the problem
   2. If necessary add a **code snippet** to make your question more clear
   3. Add a joke for good measure
   4. And please don't make your question too long, **try to be concise**
   5. Emphasize important parts of your question by using **appropriate styling**


4. After receiving answers, be appreciative and discuss further if needed
5. AIso if necessary, adjust the formulation of your question in response to useful feedback
