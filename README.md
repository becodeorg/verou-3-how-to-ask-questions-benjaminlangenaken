## How to ask a structured question

1. First **identify the problem**
2. Check if you **can't already find a solution!**
3. Try to be as **structured** as possible **when describing** your problem:
   1. Have a **short and informative title**
   2. If necessary add **(a) code snippet's**
   3. Add a joke for good measure
   4. Emphasize important parts of your question by using **appropriate styling**
   5. And please don't make your question too long, **try to be concise**



4. After receiving answers, be appreciative and **discuss further if needed**
5. Finally, **adjust** the formulation of your **question in response to useful feedback**
